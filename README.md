# Greeting Cards React App (React + Vite)

## Project Overview

This is a simple React app created as part of a project to practice creating and styling components with Vite and Tailwind CSS. The app displays a set of greeting cards with different titles and messages. 
The goal of this project was to:
- Learn how to properly create scaffold a React application using Vite.

- Create functional components in React.

- Pass props to components and render dynamic content.

- Style the components using Tailwind CSS (my personal preference being a very cute and girly design)


### Objectives:

- Build a greeting card application with three cards.

- Create a cute Header component to display a welcoming message.

- Pass props to child components (`GreetingCard`) and render content dynamically.


### What I Learned:

- How to use Vite to properly set up and configure a React project quickly.

- The basics of React components, props, and component structure.

- How to effectively style React components to match my mental picture using Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing, cute design.


## Discussion

Working on this project was an exciting and rewarding experience. I learned a lot about structuring React applications, especially when working with props and functional components. The project also gave me a deeper understanding of creating a React project, and styling React apps using Tailwind CSS, which was fun because of its utility-first approach.

The design was intended to be cute and girly, so I focused on soft pastel colors, rounded edges, and playful hover effects. One challenge I faced was ensuring the layout remained responsive across different screen sizes and trying to add litte cute icons to it, but Tailwind's responsive classes made this much easier.

 Overall, I’m happy with how the project turned out, and I’m excited to keep learning and building more with React to suite my style as Im slowly beginning to understand the concepts now.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
